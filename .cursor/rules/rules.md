# Progressive Raytracer Development Rules

## Project Process
- All specs go in `/specs` folder in markdown format
- Write specs before implementing major features
- Update rules when completing units of work

## Raytracer-Specific
- Use progressive refinement - start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Prioritize correctness over performance initially
- Make rendering results reproducible and testable
- Design for progressive enhancement (multiple passes)
